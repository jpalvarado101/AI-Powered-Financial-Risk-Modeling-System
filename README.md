## 📌 **Overview**

This project is an **end-to-end AI-powered financial risk assessment system** that predicts risk levels for **investment portfolios, credit scoring, or financial transactions**. It combines **advanced machine learning models (XGBoost, LSTMs, Transformers)** with **real-time data ingestion, deployment-ready APIs, and explainable AI techniques.**

## 🎯 **Key Features**

✅ **Financial Data Ingestion**: Uses **Yahoo Finance API**, **Quandl**, and **FRED Economic Data API** to fetch market and economic indicators.  
✅ **Advanced ML Models**: Supports **XGBoost for structured data**, **LSTMs for time series forecasting**, and **Transformers for state-of-the-art predictions**.  
✅ **Feature Engineering**: Computes **technical indicators (RSI, SMA, MACD)** and **financial ratios** for better predictive accuracy.  
✅ **Explainability with SHAP**: Understands model predictions with **Shapley Values for AI transparency**.  
✅ **Scalable API Deployment**: FastAPI-based model API for seamless risk prediction integration.  
✅ **Interactive Risk Monitoring Dashboard**: Built with **Streamlit** for real-time financial risk analysis.  
✅ **Production-Ready Deployment**: Dockerized system with **CI/CD, AWS, and Kubernetes** for scalability.

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Data Ingestion**

- Fetches real-time market and economic data from **Yahoo Finance, Quandl, and FRED APIs**.
- Stores raw data for **feature engineering and model training**.

### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**

- Computes **financial indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD)** for market trends.
- Extracts **macro-economic factors (interest rates, inflation, GDP growth).**

### **Step 3: Model Training**

- **XGBoost:** Best for structured financial data (credit scoring, risk modeling).
- **LSTMs:** Works for time-series financial forecasting.
- **Transformers (TFT):** State-of-the-art time-series forecasting.

### **Step 4: Model Explainability**

- Uses **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** to **interpret model decisions** and ensure transparency.

### **Step 5: Deployment as an API**

- **FastAPI** is used to **serve predictions via REST API**.
- The model is **containerized using Docker** and **deployed on AWS/Kubernetes**.

### **Step 6: Interactive Dashboard**

- **Streamlit UI** to visualize financial risk levels and model insights.
